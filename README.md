WIP: A simple clicker/idler with an Eco touch.

## Story

You crash landed on a planet - yeah, that kind of story.

You are the leader of the survivors of a colony ship send from Earth. 
Earth collapsed all resources were depleted and humanity fought over every piece of food and energy.
Now you can choose:
- Will you learn from Earth and build a never-ending society?
- Will you deplete the planet, build a colony ship in time and flee again?
